# arctic-atmospheric-sudden-warming

Generated contour plots of temperature and wind data in the Arctic. Analayzed the speed at which SSW occurs. Compared data collected by the SABER satellite to the WACCM model.

Completed with Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.


Note: Unfortunately, code will not run as the netCDF4 files were far too large to upload to GitHub. Contour plots and methods, however, are still visible.
